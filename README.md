# Mammogram Density Classification using PyTorch

This repository contains code for training a deep learning model for BIRADS (A, B, C, D) density classification using the RSNA dataset. The project focuses on breast density classification from mammograms, which is crucial for breast cancer detection and diagnosis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes:
- A CSV file with 54,706 entries containing attributes related to patient information and medical imaging, acquired from the [RSNA Screening Mammography Breast Cancer Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection) (registration required).
- PNG images of breast scans are sourced from [RSNA Breast Cancer Detection - 512x512 PNGs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theoviel/rsna-breast-cancer-512-pngs/data).

## Video Tutorials

I created a video series on breast density classification. Check out the links below for step-by-step guidance:
